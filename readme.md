# Instagram Login and Signup Authentication

This project implements an authentication system for Instagram-like functionality, including user login, sign-up, and a protected home page. The system utilizes React for the client-side user interface, Node.js and Express for the server, and MongoDB for data storage.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Modules Utilized

- Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling
- Cors: Cross-origin resource sharing
- Cookie-parser: Parsing cookies
- Dotenv: Managing environment variables
- Email-validator: Validating email addresses
- Bcrypt: Hashing passwords
- JWT: JSON Web Token authentication
- Nodemon: Auto-restart server during development

## API Endpoints

- `/signup`: Create a new user account by providing the required information (name, username, email, password, and bio).
- `/signupDataValidate`: Middleware to validate the sign-up data before saving it to the database.
- `/login`: Authenticate a user by providing the username and password.
- `/loginDataValidate`: Middleware to validate the login data before processing the authentication.

## Key Features

- User Signup: Allow users to create an account with their name, username, email, password, and bio.
- User Login: Authenticate users using their credentials. Upon successful login, redirect to the home page.
- Protected Home Page: Display user details on the home page. Access to the home page is protected, requiring authentication.
